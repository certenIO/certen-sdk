# Changelog — @certen.io/cli

## 0.4.0 — `--json` is a machine contract

Adds a stable, tested output contract for scripts and AI agents. **Human output is unchanged**: if
you do not pass `--json`, this release behaves exactly as 0.3.1 did, with one exception noted under
Breaking.

Before this, every failure exited `1` and explained itself in English on stderr. An automated caller
could not distinguish "you passed a malformed address" from "the gateway is down" without parsing
prose — and those want opposite responses. One is a bug to fix; the other is worth retrying. For a
CLI that authorizes cross-chain execution against real funds, guessing wrong is expensive in a way
that is not recoverable.

The full specification is [docs/CLI-CONTRACT.md](../../docs/CLI-CONTRACT.md), enforced by
`test/conformance.test.ts`, which runs the built binary as a subprocess and checks the real process's
stdout and exit code.

### Added

- **Global `--json`**, accepted anywhere in the argument list — `certen --json tx status X` and
  `certen tx status X --json` are identical. It is resolved before argument parsing, so it applies
  even to failures that occur while resolving credentials.
- **One JSON envelope on stdout and nothing else.** `{"ok":true,"data":…}` or
  `{"ok":false,"error":{"code","message","retryable","status?","requestId?"}}`. A command producing
  several payloads emits an array in `data`; one producing none emits `"data":null`. stdout is never
  empty and never carries two concatenated objects. All human-facing text moves to stderr.
- **Meaningful exit codes:** `0` ok · `1` operation failed · `2` usage error · `3` gateway
  unreachable. `3` guarantees nothing was submitted, so a retry cannot double-execute.
- **`error.retryable`**, taken from the SDK's own `CertenError.isRetryable`, so the CLI and the SDK
  hand an automated caller the identical retry decision.
- **`certen --help --json`** returns the entire command tree — every command, argument, flag and exit
  code — in one call, instead of scraping help text once per subcommand.

### Fixed

- **Usage errors on subcommands bypassed error handling entirely.** `exitOverride()` is not inherited
  by commander subcommands, so a missing required flag (`certen identity create` with no `--name`)
  called `process.exit(1)` inside commander: no envelope was emitted, stdout stayed empty, and a
  usage error was indistinguishable from a failed request. It is now applied to every command in the
  tree.

### Breaking

- **"No API key configured" now exits `2` instead of `1`.** It is a usage error: nothing was sent,
  and retrying cannot help. The same applies to a config file with unsafe permissions and to a
  missing keyring backend. Scripts treating any non-zero exit as failure are unaffected; scripts
  testing specifically for `-eq 1` need updating.

### Note

`output: "json"` in `~/.certen/config.json` is **not** this contract. That setting predates the
envelope and makes commands print their raw payload — no `ok`, no `error`, no exit-code guarantees.
It is kept for backward compatibility. Automated callers should pass `--json` explicitly rather than
depend on a machine's local config, which they cannot see.
